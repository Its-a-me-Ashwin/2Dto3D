# Calibrate 

## Steps

* Download and print the chess board (https://markhedleyjones.com/storage/checkerboards/Checkerboard-A4-30mm-8x6.pdf)
* Stick it on a rigid surface
* Run detect.py and move the camera such that the chess board appears in all regions of the screen.
* Run calibrate.py (This will generate the System.npz)
